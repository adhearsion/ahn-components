# Getting started

*ahn-components* is an Adhearsion plugin that enables backwards compatibility while loading components. This is not the preferred way to extend Adhearsion, as a new Plugin mechanism has been added in Adhearsion v2.

# Install

You should this dependency to your Adhearsion application, either in Gemfile or in gemspec file.

```
gem install ahn-components
```

# Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
* If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so I can ignore when I pull
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
